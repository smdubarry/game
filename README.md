# Mini Colony Simulator

This is a simple browser-based game that simulates a growing community. Villagers wander around, gather food from farmland, and build houses when enough resources are collected. Houses automatically produce more villagers over time. Graphics are rendered with simple emojis instead of sprite art.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Watch as the villagers move and expand their colony.
3. Use the **Pause** button to pause or resume the simulation.
4. Use **Add Villager** to introduce a new villager manually.

Food and population counts are displayed below the canvas. Villagers age over time and eventually die, and each villager and house receives a unique procedural name. Hover your mouse over a villager or house to see its details.
