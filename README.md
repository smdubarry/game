# Mini Colony Simulator

This is a simple browser-based game that simulates a growing community. Villagers wander around, gather food from farmland, and build houses when enough resources are collected. Houses automatically produce more villagers over time. The game now uses sprites from the Kenney Roguelike/RPG pack for all tiles and characters.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Watch as the villagers move and expand their colony.
3. Use the **Pause** button to pause or resume the simulation.
4. Use **Add Villager** to introduce a new villager manually.

Food and population counts are displayed below the canvas. Villagers will automatically build houses when enough food is gathered, and new villagers are spawned periodically.
